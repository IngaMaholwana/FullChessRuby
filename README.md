# FullChessRuby

This is a ruby project for [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.



## Game rules
It was created based on rules found on [Illustrated rules of chess](http://www.chessvariants.org/d.chess/chess.html).

## How to run the program
* Open your terminal, navigate to the folder where game files exit (i.e. cd Documents/Chess).
* Run the command `bundle install` to install required dependencies (libraries / ruby gems).
* Run the command `bundle exec ruby main.rb`.
